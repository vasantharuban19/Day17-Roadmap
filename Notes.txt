Promise
 - What is a promise?
 - Promise States
 - Promise chain
 - promise.all()
 - Use of fetch() & then()

 Callbackhell:- 
   function a1(){
    function a2(){
        function a3(){
            console.log("Hi hello")
        }
    }
   }

   Promise:- 
   => It holds the result of async operation.
   => To overcome the problem of Callbackhell scenario promise is used.
   => It is an object, which holds the result of async operation.
   Syntax:- let/const variablename = new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{})
   Promise States:- 
   for every promise objects we have 3 states,
   1.pending
   2.Fullfilled / resolved
   3.rejected

   .then and catch
   => To handle the promise object we are going to use then and catch

   //session task voting
   18 or above => eligible to vote
   17 or below = > not eligible to vote

   //promise chain
   => chaining of promise
   => Dependent operation
   => first promise output will be the input of second promise.

   //promise.all()
   => It is used when we have multiple promises
   => It will wait for all the promises to get resolved.
   => It returns an array of values.
   //Drawbacks
   => if one promise gets rejected it wont go for other.
   => it will display the information of the rejected promise.
   
   //promise.allsettled
   => when you want know the state of each promise.
   => output will be a promise object.
   => It will be more usefull when you dont have dependent operation.
